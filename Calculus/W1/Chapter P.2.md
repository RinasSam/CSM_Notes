Many equations have multiple forms to be expressed, each having a particular purpose and accomplishing a particular goal. Here are some of the most commonly used ones and their use cases:

| Form Name | Formula | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General Form | $ax + by + c = 0$ | Not much besides helping with some formulas. |
| Point-Slope Form | $y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)$ | Necessary for finding an equation that passes through a certain point. |
| Slope-Intercept Form | $y = mx+b$ | The classic. Useful for graphing and finding intercepts, or analyzing the graph of a linear function. |
| Vertical Line | $x=a$| nfc.|
| Horizontal Line | $y=b$ | nfc.|
 
- Two equations are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal.
- Two equations are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is $-1\text{ (i.e. \ \ \ } \text{  } m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1 \text{ \ \ or \ \ } m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}\text{)}$.
