## Naturalism

During the 19th century, most dramas and plays followed the idea of Romanticism, and as such often were blown out melodramas filled with emotional significance and nature. However, a deeper inspection would reveal that such things are rather inaccurate and unnatural. As such, this led to a rise of a counter: Naturalism.

Naturalism uses realistic plots, settings, and explores human condition and the effect of life on humans. This was much more believable and sane.


## Satire

Satire is a form of mockery, often used to ridicule and criticize certain aspects about life and society.


## Farce

Farce is comedy that spirals down into insane and impossible events. It's crazy, yes, but very entertaining when done right/


## Plot

Plot is the most important part of a literary work, the driving waves that make the work compelling and worthwhile. The common established plot structure goes like so:
- Exposition
- Development/Rising Action
- Climax
- Falling Action
- Resolution

It must be noted that this structure is not completely universal. Some authors and playwrights play with said structure, which creates a unique and interesting experience.


## Theme

A literary work often wishes to teach a lesson or advocate a theme. Shakespeare's *"Julius Caesar"* for instance, has the theme of betrayal. The theme is the central idea that the literary work attempts to communicate. There may be more minor or major themes, but in general many works have a singular central theme that defines them.
