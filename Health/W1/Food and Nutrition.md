Food is essential for survival, as it gives us fuel to go about our lives. Our digestive system is quite elaborate and efficient in absorbing nutrients from foods. The digestive system is separated into two parts:

| Alimentary Tract | Accessory Organs |
|---| --- |
| Contains organs such as the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, the colon, and the rectum. The food moves through said organs. | Contains organs such as the tongue (with teeth), salivary glands, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, etc. These organs provide secretions and aid in digestion of the food.


## Mouth

In the mouth, the teeth cut and physically break down the food. The saliva moistens the 
food, and begins digesting carbohydrates via salivary amylase.


## Pharynx and Esophagus

The epiglottis blocks the larynx and the airways, and then these two organs push the food from the mouth to the stomach via peristalsis (mixing waves of contraction and dilation.)
