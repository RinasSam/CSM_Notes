Infancy and childhood are often categorized as taking place from birth till puberty (usually from 0 - 12/13 years old). This period may be categorized into multiple sections, but that does not concern health, and rather concerns medicine. Hence, we use a simplified partitioning for this. Keep in mind that the time periods for each stage differ on a person to person basis.

## Stage 1: Learning New Skills (0 - 18 months)

Babies are fast learners. Hell, they are the fastest learners. At first, they begin working their limbs. They move their hands, feet, look at people, crawl, etc. Muscle coordination begins at this stage. They physically grow in size, grow hair, muscles, and whatnot. 


## Stage 2: Independence (18 months - 3 years)

As the baby grows (they still continue growing in size), their muscle coordination become more precise. They begin working out fine movements allowing them to learn how to speak very simply (their vocabulary increases) and handle objects on their own. They can begin to act independently, meaning they need less care.


## Stage 3: Curiosity (3 years - 6 years)

As the child grows, it begins to form a simple sense of logic and curiosity. The child may begin asking lots and lots of questions about the world around them. They explore and test the world around them. They begin to socialize with others (rather basically to note), and interactions become more common with their surrounding environments. They also begin to understand emotions, and learn to lie (literally unplayable).


## Stage 4: Broadening Interest (6 years - 12 years)

So curiosity, but now it has proper direction. Socialization peaks at this stage for the child, and they begin to have personalized interests. This is all coupled with significant improvements to every other skill of theirs.
