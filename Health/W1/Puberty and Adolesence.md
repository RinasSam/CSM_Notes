What follows [Infancy and Childhood](Infancy%20and%20Childhood.md) is Puberty and Adolescence. This usually starts from ages 12-14, and ends at around 18-20. 


## Hormones

Puberty is characterized by the increased activity of the male and female gonads, releasing hormones such as testosterone for the male, and estrogen and progesterone for females. Here is a table for endocrine hormones because I'm lazy:

These hormones released by the gonads stimulate secondary sex characteristics. Such as changing body shape, facial hair, voice changes, etc. These changes often have significant effects on the mind and behaviour of the person. Many teenagers are rebellious, emotionally driven, sometimes "edgy", and the like. As a teenager grows, they begin to solidify their logic and reasoning skills, and they develop a personality of their owns.


## Steroids and External Hormone Intake

Basically taking steroids stops body production of hormones like testosterone. This causes issues in the body and if you stop using it, you begin having massive skill issue. This is because the pituitary gland cannot differentiate between internally made and externally in-taken hormones, and thus stops the body glands from producing hormones. Hence, skill issue.
