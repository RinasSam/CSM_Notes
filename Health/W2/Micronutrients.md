Micronutrients are nutrients that our body needs but in far less amounts than macronutrients (such as iron, zinc, vitamins, and phosphorus).


## Functions of Micronutrients:
- They can function as **catalysts** for enzymes and reaction.
- They can function as **antioxidants** (mainly the utility of vitamins like C and E).
- They can function as **coenzymes** and help with proper body function.


## Vitamins:

Vitamins are divided into *water soluble* (C and B's$^{1}$  ) and *fat soluble* (ADEK) vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins stay in the body for longer periods of time, and water soluble ones do not and henceforth must be taken on a consistent basis.


## Vitamin Deficiency:

Vitamin deficiency can cause massive skill issues inside the body. 

| Disease/Condition | Effects of Disease | Cause of Disease |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rickets** | Reduction of bone strength | Little Vitamin D |
| **Poor blood coagulation** | Blood cannot clot to stop wounds from leaking blood | Little Vitamin K |
| **Night Blindness** | Can't see at night (nfs) | Little Vitamin A |
