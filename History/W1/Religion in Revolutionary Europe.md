## The Struggle Against the Catholic Church

Religious figures had obscene amounts of power before the 18th century. The Pope was essentially an emperor, able to appoint and exalt people from and to positions of power. The clergy long have used religion as a claw in order to grip the people sturdily.

However, as time would go on, people would grow to hate on the Church and its power, especially the poor people. They felt as if the Church was not wishing to help them, and as the Church began to care more and more about taxes and wealth, people began to lose faith.


## Luther and Calvin Propose Reforms:

This all came to a boil when **Martin Luther**, a German monk, came in the 16th century and criticized the Catholic Church, giving a list of 99 reasons as to why the Church sucked (especially when it came to being able to buy one's way to heaven \[tokhwa matry 3arz la bahasht ba 1000 dollar abe?\]). With Martin Luther's seminal work, a new branch or sect of Christianity emerged that protested against the Catholic Church, and they were dubbed now as **Protestants.** Luther argued that much of the practices and structures of the Church had been invented without proper reference to the basis of Christianity (the Bible, the Apostle's teachings, etc).

Another man, French, by the name of **John Calvin**, came after Luther, also came and critiqued the Church. While many of his points were similar to Luther's, some of his were wildly different. 
1. For instance, Calvin popularized the belief of predestination: the idea that *no free will exists*, and that everyone's path is laid down from the beginning. 
2. Another important note is that Calvin wished to model the state after the religion, not having the religion succumb to the state. This gives off massive revolution energy (French people ong). 
3. Most importantly, Calvin wished to strip the power and the hierarchy of the Church, priests, and the bishops, which was unlike Luther's ideas. Calvin advocated for the Church to be simple like the time of Jesus, and brought forth the idea of the people communicated with God and Jesus directly, without a mediator in between in the form of a priest or bishop. 


## The Impact of Calvinism and Lutheranism

Both of these people were massively influential, and changed people's views around all of Europe. People's perspective on the Catholic Church shifted, and many religious reforms took place. For instance, King Henry VIII decided the Catholic Church was a load of dog water and stripped its power from Britain completely because he could not get a second wife to harbour a male heir (he still did not get a male heir after this, massive L).

(To quote the Bible):
> **Matthew 19 - NLV:**
> *11 But Jesus said to them, “Not all men are able to do this, but only those to whom it has been given. 12 For there are some men who from birth will never be able to have children. There are some men who have been made so by men. There are some men who have had themselves made that way because of the holy nation of heaven. The one who is able to do this, let him do it.”*

It was only after two monarchs (Queen Mary and Elizabeth) that proper balance and Protestantism would be practiced in England. However, this version of Protestantism would not be set in stone. It was very flexible for the believers, allowing for many kinds of beliefs and practices to coexist.
