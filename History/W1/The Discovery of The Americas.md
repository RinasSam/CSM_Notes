The discovery of the American continents marked an important period for European exploration. Massive landmasses were found, filled to brim with resources and and various cultures never before seen. 

The history of the Americas is rather important, as it provides crucial context that serves as the canvas for the current painting of the American world. Without knowing the history, confusion and conflicts shall rise. Hence, let us begin.


## Native Settlers

It is unknown who truly is "native" to the Americas, as it is hypothesized that people migrated from Asia to the Americas through Alaska hundreds of thousands years ago. The people lived together, isolated from the world, for many years.


## The European Voyages

The first people to set foot on the Far West were the Vikings. They found modern day Greenland and possibly Newfoundland. Their primary goal was to plunder and acquire loot. However, they did not explore the entire landmass(es), and so left the Far West soon.

Christopher Columbus was a European sailor and explorer. He wished to find a waterway to India, because the Ottomans were blocking the trade routes. He hypothesized that they can sail around the Earth to India. He had difficulty getting funding for his mission, but when he did, he sailed and found the main landmass of the Americas. The natives were known as *Red Indians*, as they thought they were in India.

However, later explorers, particularly Amerigo Vesipucci, theorized that Columbus did not sail to India, but rather a part of a large never before seen land. In fact, the name "America" comes from his first name. 

The European love for exploration and trade was great, and as such, the peoples of Europe began to travel to the Americas and explore the land and peoples.
