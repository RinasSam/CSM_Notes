The discovery of the American continents marked an important period for European exploration. Massive landmasses were found, filled to brim with resources and and various cultures never before seen. 

The history of the Americas is rather important, as it provides crucial context that serves as the canvas for the current painting of the American world. Without knowing the history, confusion and conflicts shall rise. Hence, let us begin.


## Native Settlers

It is unknown who truly is "native" to the Americas, as it is hypothesized that people migrated from Asia to the Americas through Alaska hundreds of thousands years ago. The people lived together, isolated from the world, for many years.


## The European Voyages

The first people to set foot on the Far West were the Vikings. They found modern day Greenland and possibly Newfoundland. Their primary goal was to plunder and acquire loot. However, they did not explore the entire landmass(es), and so left the Far West soon.

Christopher Columbus was a European sailor and explorer. He wished to find a waterway to India, because the Ottomans were blocking the trade routes. He hypothesized that they can sail around the Earth to India. He had difficulty getting funding for his mission, but when he did (thanks to the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella), he sailed and found the main landmass of the Americas. The natives were known as *Red Indians*, as they thought they were in India.

However, later explorers, particularly Amerigo Vesipucci, theorized that Columbus did not sail to India, but rather a part of a large never before seen land. In fact, the name "America" comes from his first name. 


## Why The Europeans Explored The Americas

The European love for exploration and trade was great, and as such, the peoples of Europe began to travel to the Americas and explore the land and peoples.

- New cultures are always intriguing, stimulating the mind to learn more. Many of the Europeans were fascinated by the native people, and as such **sought to learn more about them and their lifestyles**.
- Newly found lands often have large amounts of **riches** and treasure. Past explorers have written and spoken about the foreign treasures of the East, and this sparked the imaginations of the explorers who wished to make a profit out of their voyages.
- New lands also are great places of **settlement**. New settlements can be great strategic positions to establish trade routes and control over more land. In addition, they can house more people more comfortably than the crowded cities of Europe.
- Old trade routes can become expensive and dangerous over time as more people used them. New trade routes can be extremely profitable and if a nation can secure a trade route for itself, it becomes a powerful asset to their income.
- Religious missions and glory.


## The Elusive East

The East had always been known as a place of great wealth and important resources. Silk, spices, and jewelry are such resources that the Europeans valued greatly. Nations such as France, England, Spain, and Portugal benefited greatly from trading with the East. However, with the rise of the Ottoman Empire, many trade routes were blocked or became economically nonviable. 

These states could fund a new route to the East, and Columbus wanted to use that to find a route to India and the East, free of danger or interference from the Ottomans. Columbus had difficulty persuading rulers to fund him, as his idea was quite literally outlandish. Such a voyage is quite difficult, and there are many chances for failure. He was rejected by the British, Austrians, French, and Portuguese, but the Spanish agreed to fund him. On August 3, 1492, he set sail aboard the Santa Maria, and he was lucky as shit in surviving and getting to the Americas safely.
