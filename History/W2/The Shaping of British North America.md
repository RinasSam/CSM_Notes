As stated in [Religion in Revolutionary Europe](../W1/Religion%20in%20Revolutionary%20Europe.md), the religious tensions in the region served as major catalysts for further conflict and disconnect in Europe. Monarch's and secular leaders were in constant conflicts with the Pope and the religious leaders.

In the 1500s, the English were disrupting Spain's colonial goals, and so the Spaniards went to a "war" against Britain and they had the upper hand, but they were reckless and thus lost the confrontation. Due to this war, they started getting a lead which allowed them to be able to colonize North America. In fact, this was the very start of the British fleet's dominance over Europe.



## Colonial Life

However, the colonists did not come prepared well for living in their colonies. The land was wildly different, and so were the people and the crops. It was rather difficult for them to even survive, let alone thrive. It was increasingly difficult to make a profit and they were on the verge of collapse. 

This continued until they discovered tobacco, which became an economically stable and extremely profitable crop. This allowed them to actually survive and saved the colonies from being abandoned and collapsed.1
