Charles Dickens was a British writer in the [Victorian Period](Victorian%20Period.md).


## His Novels:
### Publishing Style 

People were purchasing his novels in partly installments, which was a smart move since it was great for the people who cannot afford a full length novel in one go, and great for publishers who could boost their sales and promote the novels.


### Writing Style

Dickens often utilized *pathos*, or writings that invoke pity or sympathy towards others.
He also made clever use of *irony* and *satire*. One may say that his prose contained many varieties and elements such that it ended up like a passage of music, colourful and filled with subtle (and sometimes loud) undertones embedded within his writing. This creates a driving motion much like rhythm creates a driving force for music. A *musical prose* is often the term used to describe his style.
