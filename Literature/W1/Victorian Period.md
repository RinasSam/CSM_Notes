The Victorian Period is a paradoxical age, with many advancements and regressions happening at the same time.


## The Rise of The Novels

The novels were rising in popularity for a multitude of reasons. The main one being the ***hastening of people's lives.*** As people became more literate and had less time on their hands to watch full length plays, novels became more enticing. Their partitioned nature allows people to read a section, live their lives, and then continue later when they wish.

In addition, writing was considered an honourable job in the old times. However, as time went on, talent was being weeded out as more subpar works were published over time to the present day.


## Romanticism vs Victorianism: The Literary Differences

- Romanticism focused on emotions and nature, and often times would blow out certain aspects in an unrealistic way for the sake of story telling. In addition, much of their focus was on nature and the upsides of life.
- - Victorianism took a more realist approach. As such, their writings were distressing and dark, reflecting the cruel world they live in. They attempt to portray the real world and as such focus on day to day lives. 

We may consider Romantic works more entertaining and stimulating for the mind and imagination of the reader, while Victorian works are more "useful" as a learning tool for people. Their depiction of life can prove to be very useful for people who seek validation for their situations, or want to see how people act in certain cases.
