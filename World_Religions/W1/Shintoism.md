Shintoism is a religion based in the Far East, mainly in **Japan**, were it is considered the indigenous (or rather the original) religion of Japan. It is very ancient religion, and survives even in the modern day. The religion is rather cultic in nature, and the followers have certain pride and honour to be Shintos.


## The Origin of Shintoism

It is believed that much like many other religions, Shintoism is born from and heavily emphasizes the worship of nature. This could have been an attempt to explain the world around them, but nevertheless, they respected and honoured nature, often worshipping spirits that they believe to be the manifestations of various elements of nature such as rivers, plants, and celestial beings.


## The Heart of Shintoism

Shintoism teaches devotions to sacred spirits and higher beings known as Kami (such as the DBZ Kami, who is essentially a god that looks over the Earth). Kami is not just reserved for a god, rather, it is a diverse term that includes many gods and goddesses that are concerned with the well being of humanity.

The Kami are quite varied, and there is one for each aspect of life. The preferences and personality of each Kami differs from one to another and they all depend on the context of said Kami.

#### Examples of Kami
- **Amaterasu:** The most important Kami, the sun goddess, associated with light and harmony.
- **Inari:** Associated with agriculture and prosperity.

The Kami in Shintoism are **all-present** (omnipresent) and **all-knowing** (omniscient).
