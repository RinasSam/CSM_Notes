Shintoism is a religion based in the Far East, mainly in **Japan**, were it is considered the indigenous (or rather the original) religion of Japan. It is very ancient religion, and survives even in the modern day. The religion is rather cultic in nature, and the followers have certain pride and honour to be Shintos.


## The Origin of Shintoism

It is believed that much like many other religions, Shintoism is born from and heavily emphasizes the worship of nature. This could have been an attempt to explain the world around them, but nevertheless, they respected and honoured nature, often worshipping spirits that they believe to be the manifestations of various elements of nature such as rivers, plants, and celestial beings.


## The Heart of Shintoism

Shintoism teaches devotions to sacred spirits and higher beings known as Kami (such as the DBZ Kami, who is essentially a god that looks over the Earth). Kami is not just reserved for a god, rather, it is a diverse term that includes many gods and goddesses that are concerned with the well being of humanity.

The Kami are quite varied, and there is one for each aspect of life. The preferences and personality of each Kami differs from one to another and they all depend on the context of said Kami.

#### Examples of Kami
- **Amaterasu:** The most important Kami, the sun goddess, associated with light and harmony.
- **Inari:** Associated with agriculture and prosperity.

The Kami in Shintoism are **all-present** (omnipresent) and **all-knowing** (omniscient).


## History of Shintoism


In the 6th century BC, the name "Shinto" came to be. Originally, all the people had a similar way of life and religion. When Buddhism and Confucianism rose to popularity, the Shintos gave a name to their religion as a way to differentiate themselves from those two religious groups, despite them having many similarities.

Shintoism initially lacked any form of scripture or written doctrines, and instead directed its attention to religious rituals and customs (actions > text).


## Sacred Texts

Shintoism does have scripture and sacred texts. One such text is the **Kojiki** (*Records of Ancient Matters*), the oldest surviving text, dating back to the 8th century BC. Another text is the **Nihon Shoki** (*Chronicles of Japan*), coming later but being far more detailed and elaborate than its predecessor.


## Varieties of Shinto

- **Shrine Shinto:** Focuses on worshipping Kami at shrines.
- **Imperial Shinto:** Closely tied to the imperial family, ceremonies, and rituals.
- **Folk Shinto:** Refers to the local beliefs.
- **Sect Shinto:** Various sects or religious groups with distinct teachings and practices.
- **Ancient Shinto:** The earliest form of Shinto, predating Buddhism and Confucianism (somehow it still is practiced).
Each one had a preferred selection of Kami to worship (and a preferred selection of traits to give to them \[i.e. a different perspective on said Kami\]).

We cannot rationalize the spiritual and religion. Logic and common sense is impossible to apply to such supernatural matters, because these techniques have their roots grounded in the real world. Since we are talking about a whole different realm of reality, we cannot rationalise. Instead, we must have faith.
