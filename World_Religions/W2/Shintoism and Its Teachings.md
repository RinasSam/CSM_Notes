An important concept in Shintoism is **Yomi** or **Yomi-no-kuni** (The Land of The Dead) where the dead's spirits reside. Even though Shintoism's focus on The Land of The Dead is not as much as other mythologies, it is still filled with stories and plays an important part in the lore.


## Creation:

Shintoism teaches that Japan was the first landmass to be created in the world, and rituals must be performed in order to protect Japan from any bad events or things.

In Shintoism, the universe was created by a primordial Chaos (very similar to Khaos in Greek lore). Automatically, Kami appeared after creation. The relationships between them gave rise to a divine Kami couple: Izanagi and Izanami. 

These two were tasked with creating the world, and so they gave birth to the islands, deities, and natural elements. They stirred the ocean with a spear, and saltwater dripped from the tip and made landmass.

Izanagi is "The Male Who Invites". He is associated with light and purification. Izanami is "The Female Who Invites", symbolizing darkness and creation.


## Prominent Deities

Amaterasu and Susanoo are siblings and are some of the most important Kami. 

Amaterasu is associated with the welfare of the Japanese people, and is the Sun goddess, the ancestor of the imperial family. The Japanese emperors are believed to be her descendants.

Susanoo is the Kami of storms, seas, moon, and ruler of heavens (literally Poseidon). He is unpredictable and violent. Even though he has his conflicts with his sister (this is a classic, all siblings are wack), he is still important and revered.


## Purification

Purification is a key element in rituals, especially for cleanliness and maintaining harmony. This concept, known as "**harae**" is very important in Shinto belief, and it is necessary to cleanse impurities (such as bad deeds).

Water, for instance, is a popular purifying agent and a sacred element. It often involves washing hands and mouth, very similar to Wudu.
